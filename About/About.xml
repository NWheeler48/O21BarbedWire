--- Paladins additions ---
Raiders will destroy it if they are given no route into the base or better target to attack, much like power cables. I do not intend to change this behaviour.
This version removes an issue with the old unofficial update which caused issues in other mods by overwriting vanilla abstracts unnecessarily.
	
--- Original Description ---
Adds barbed wire, a simple defensive structure that slows movement and provides minimal cover</description>
